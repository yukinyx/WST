                <p>Welcome to <strong>Red Market</strong>, an online shop created to make BSU requirements easier and more convenient to buy. The platform works like a mini Shopee or Amazon made specifically for BSU students who need fast access to official items without the hassle of going around campus.</p>
                
                <p>Red Market is developed by third year students who wanted to solve a simple but common problem on campus, which is the struggle of finding and buying required items. Instead of jumping from building to building or waiting in long lines, students can now browse everything in one organized place. The team wanted to create something practical and helpful, using technology to make campus life smoother and more efficient.</p>
                
                <p>Our goal is to support the BSU community by offering requirement-ready items that follow the university’s standards. With Red Market, we aim to innovate how students shop for essentials, giving everyone a reliable and accessible platform that saves time and reduces stress.</p>
